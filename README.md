## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Firebase Account](https://firebase.google.com/)
- Smartwatch API or BLE Device Support  

---
 📁 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-smartwatch-health-tracker.git
cd ai-smartwatch-health-tracker
````

### 📦 Install Dependencies
bash
npm install

## 🔧 Firebase Setup

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project
3. Enable:

   * Firestore Database
   * Email/Password Authentication
4. Add your app to Firebase and get the config

### 🔥 Replace this in `src/firebase.js`:
js
import firebase from 'firebase/app';
import 'firebase/firestore';
import 'firebase/auth';

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
};

const firebaseApp = firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
const db = firebaseApp.firestore();
export default db;
```

---

## 📤 Smartwatch API Integration

Replace dummy API URLs in your project with the real one from your smartwatch:

```js
const response = await fetch("https://your-smartwatch-api.com/health-data");
```

You can simulate data locally using mock APIs during development.
